      <description>This is a short reference piece that I contributed to Educative.io&amp;rsquo;s Edpresso series. Before writing this piece, my experience with Ruby had been limited; I therefore considered this a research challenge. After carefully reading through enough documentation to be sure that I understood the concepts, I was able to communicate them clearly, and concisely enough to fit into Educative&amp;rsquo;s short-form Edpresso format. The finished product can be seen here.</description>

      <description>During my time at Copperfield&amp;rsquo;s Books, I was asked to produce a document to facilitate the training of new employees. The document serves as a how-to guide, and covers receiving new shipments, both from vendors, and from other Copperfield&amp;rsquo;s locations, as well as vendor returns. It includes both quick start guides for easy reference, as well as detailed instructions for training purposes.
The document was created in Microsoft Word, and was used successfully to train new hires, as well as to train current employees on new skills.</description>

      <title>Walk-Through - Simple Machine Translation</title>

      <description>My favorite project that I completed during my time at San Francisco State University was my capstone project in linguistics. The professor allowed us quite a bit of artistic license when it came to our write-ups, and we were able to largely define our own projects, as long as they met a certain set of criteria. I chose a project centered around machine learning; specifically machine translation. I assembled a corpus, created a model, and presented my work in an interactive write-up in the form of a Google CoLab notebook.</description>
